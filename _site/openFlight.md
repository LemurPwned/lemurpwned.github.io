#### Open Flight planes

We could suspect that the biggest airlines will be mostly using the same airplanes right?
It's interesting to see that generally big airlines have varied fleet with classic Boeing 737 leading the score in most.

It seems that this is mostly true that there are several *classic* planes 
popular across multiple airlines. However, we can se several outsiders as well.
