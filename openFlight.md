#### Open Flight planes

We could suspect that the biggest airlines will be mostly using the same airplanes right?
Let's find out!

<HTML>
<style>
  body {
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  }
  #main {
    width: 960px;
  }
  .axis .domain {
    display: none;
  }
</style>
<div id="main">
  <svg width="960" height="500"></svg>
</div>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script src="./stacked-airplanes/stacked.js"></script>
</HTML>
It seems that this is mostly true that there are several *classic* planes 
popular across multiple airlines. However, we can se several outsiders as well.
